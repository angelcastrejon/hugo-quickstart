Hi there! My name is Angel. Join me as I embark on this blogging journey, where I'll share my experiences, insights, and enthusiasm for data engineering, analytics, and artificial intelligence.

## Who Am I?

I am a Data and Analytics Engineer by trade, who has also architected data solutions at an enterprise scale. My journey began at GameFly as a Business Analyst Intern, where I was later hired full-time after completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from CSU Fullerton.

## My Interests

My interests revolve around using technology to solve complex problems. Whether it's building fault-tolerant data pipelines, designing scalable analytics platforms, or experimenting with machine learning, I'm all in. I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of AI to transform industries, enhance human capabilities, and create a more interconnected world.

However, my curiosity isn't limited to software development. I'm a voracious consumer of stand-up comedy, avid follower of the latest in physics and space exploration, and enjoy experimenting with different flavors in baking and cooking. Oh and I played the clarinet from 8th-12th grade. (Bass clarinet and contra bass clarinet too!) The bass and contra-bass were for concert hall performances. If you have never seen a bass or contra-bass before, a bass clarinet looks like a clarinet was shot with the opposite of a shrink ray, an anti-shrink ray if you will. A contra-bass has two variations, version 1 looks it was hit but that anti-shrink ray, and version 2 looks like a radioactive paperclip bit a bass clarinet then hit with an anti-shrink ray again. All this to say that this is where my appreciation for music stems from. However, my love for a groovy funky bass line will always make me smile.

PS I have been known to play video game on NES, N64, GameBoy, DS, Wii, Switch, XBOX, XBOX 360, XBONE, PS1/2/3/4, and PSP... to name a few.

## Why blog?

This blog is more than a platform for sharing knowledge; it's a space for connecting with like-minded individuals, sparking conversations, and fostering a community of tech enthusiasts and dreamers. Here, I will share insights from my professional experiences, general interests, and explore the intersection of technology with society.

## Let's Connect

Whether you are a fellow data professional, an AI enthusiast, or simply curious about the impact of technology on our world, I invite you to join me on this journey. Let's explore the possibilities and build a future where technology amplifies our potential.
