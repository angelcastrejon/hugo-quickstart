<p>Hi there! My name is Angel. Join me as I embark on this blogging journey, where I&rsquo;ll share my experiences, insights, and enthusiasm for data engineering, analytics, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<h2 id="who-am-i">Who Am I?</h2>
<p>I am a Data and Analytics Engineer by trade, who has also architected data solutions at an enterprise scale. My journey began at GameFly as a Business Analyst Intern, where I was later hired full-time after completing my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science from CSU Fullerton.</p>
<h2 id="my-interests">My Interests</h2>
<p>My interests revolve around using technology to solve complex problems. Whether it&rsquo;s building fault-tolerant data pipelines, designing scalable analytics platforms, or experimenting with machine learning, I&rsquo;m all in. I&rsquo;m particularly fascinated by the potential of AI to transform industries, enhance human capabilities, and create a more interconnected world.</p>
<p>However, my curiosity isn&rsquo;t limited to software development. I&rsquo;m a voracious consumer of stand-up comedy, avid follower of the latest in physics and space exploration, and enjoy experimenting with different flavors in baking and cooking. Oh and I played the clarinet from 8th-12th grade. (Bass clarinet and contra bass clarinet too!) The bass and contra-bass were for concert hall performances. If you have never seen a bass or contra-bass before, a bass clarinet looks like a clarinet was shot with the opposite of a shrink ray, an anti-shrink ray if you will. A contra-bass has two variations, version 1 looks it was hit but that anti-shrink ray, and version 2 looks like a radioactive paperclip bit a bass clarinet then hit with an anti-shrink ray again. All this to say that this is where my appreciation for music stems from. However, my love for a groovy funky bass line will always make me smile.</p>
<p>PS I have been known to play video game on NES, N64, GameBoy, DS, Wii, Switch, XBOX, XBOX 360, XBONE, PS1/2/3/4, and PSP&hellip; to name a few.</p>
<h2 id="why-blog">Why blog?</h2>
<p>This blog is more than a platform for sharing knowledge; it&rsquo;s a space for connecting with like-minded individuals, sparking conversations, and fostering a community of tech enthusiasts and dreamers. Here, I will share insights from my professional experiences, general interests, and explore the intersection of technology with society.</p>
<h2 id="lets-connect">Let&rsquo;s Connect</h2>
<p>Whether you are a fellow data professional, an AI enthusiast, or simply curious about the impact of technology on our world, I invite you to join me on this journey. Let&rsquo;s explore the possibilities and build a future where technology amplifies our potential.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more posts, and feel free to reach out through my social media channels.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
